# Serverless-Web-App-Hosting-In-Cloud

Project Description:

Serverless computing simplifies application development by abstracting away server management tasks. With AWS Serverless Platform, developers focus solely on coding, while AWS handles server provisioning and configuration. This approach reduces infrastructure management overhead that usually takes place in traditional on-premises.Serverless architecture enables cost-effective application deployment and flexible scaling. By leveraging AWS, developers can focus on application code instead of worrying about provisioning, configuring, and managing servers.
